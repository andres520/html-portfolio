<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a dynamic professional with a unique blend of technical expertise and interpersonal skills. As a Mechatronics Engineer
  with a focus on Artificial Intelligence, machine vision and machine learning, I've built a strong foundation in cutting-edge
  technology. This academic background seamlessly complements my practical experience as a Full Stack Developer, where I'm
  proficient in building web applications using .NET, Angular, SQL, and JavaScript. I'm driven by a passion for creating 
  efficient and innovative solutions, and I consistently seek to expand my knowledge and master new technologies, which is why
  I continue to learn things like Python, Node.js, and React.</p>

<p>I see myself as someone with a pretty diverse skill set. I'm a Mechatronics Engineer, and that background, especially my
  focus on AI, has been incredibly useful in my work as a Full Stack Developer. I'm comfortable building web applications with
  .NET, Angular, SQL, JavaScript, and similar technologies. Beyond the technical side, I've also gained valuable experience in the 
  BPO industry, working as a Medical Interpreter and in healthcare coordination. I think this combination of skills allows me to
  approach challenges from different perspectives and communicate effectively with a wide range of people.</p>

<p>I consider myself a versatile problem-solver with a strong blend of technical and communication abilities. My degree in Mechatronics
 Engineering, with its focus on AI, provides a solid foundation for my work as a Full Stack Developer. I enjoy designing and building 
 applications using .NET, Angular, SQL, JavaScript, and I'm always eager to learn more. In addition to my development skills, my 
 experience in the BPO sector, particularly as a Medical Interpreter and Coordinator, has given me valuable insights into healthcare 
 operations and the importance of clear communication. I thrive in environments where I can leverage both my technical and interpersonal
 skills to find effective solutions.</p>
